Cloud Computing Projects 
In this part, we have categorized the Cloud Computing projects into two sections - freshers and experienced.

Cloud Computing Projects For Freshers
1. Cloud-enabled attendance system
Using a cloud-enabled automatic attendance system, we can check information. All of the observed information can also be instantaneously synced and saved on the cloud. Check-in and check-out times, dates, and the total number of working hours are just a few examples of detailed data that can be recorded and stored. Administrators must enter personal information and register new users on the system. 

A cloud-based attendance system has the following advantages: 

Data and analytics: Producing reports is easy. 
Flexibility: There are many different methods for monitoring attendance. 
Remote management: Cloud-based attendance solutions make use of software that can be accessed on any Internet-connected device from any place.
2. Bus Ticketing and Payment System
Customers will be able to purchase a bus pass online as part of this project. The website provides alternatives for scheduling, paying for, and reserving buses. By entering their login credentials into the portal, users can buy bus passes.

3. Build a Personal Cloud Storage Solution
To develop a personal cloud storage solution as your cloud computing project, you must select a cloud platform (such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure) and a programming language (such as Python, Java, C++, or Ruby) to build a server-side application. A database, such as one that is SQL- or NoSQL-based, is also required in order to save data. Once the application is complete, you can upload it to the cloud platform where you may store data and access it from any internet-connected device.

4. Online blood bank system
For this project, you will design a blood bank system that includes blood type, donor information, storage capacity, and blood deposit sites. Information about the blood bank is kept in the cloud. This will assist users in determining blood donors by comparing the data entered into the system with the data recorded in the database.

5. Online cloud-enabled bookstore system
The first step in completing this project is to create a management system for a bookstore that would distinguish and organize books into conveniently accessible sections and categories.

The user looks for a specific book by typing the title or the author's name. A cloud-based system is used to store the data and information.

Cloud Computing Projects For Experienced
6. Making a chatbot
A chatbot is a piece of artificially intelligent software that answers to user inquiries. Those queries might apply to an employee or a student, depending on the situation. But the new software claims to make it easy for beginners to build apps with a cloud-based database that let students submit questions and receive responses.

Do you wish to know the process used to select the right responses for this project? In those chatbots that use NLP, or natural language processing, and ML, or machine learning algorithms to answer queries from learners in a goal-oriented manner, a list of pertinent responses will be entered. This is merely one of the elements that contribute to the project's popularity and support among many cloud computing enthusiasts. The project also requires communication with the website you are using, which cannot be avoided.

When the website is linked to the chatbot, it is possible to find out how many users have started chatting with it as well as how well the project is addressing the variety of visitors who are constantly looking for someone to help them meet their needs.        

7. Cloud-based conversational interface
A chatbot is a piece of artificial intelligence software. Most businesses have included chatbots to their websites to improve customer service and increase efficiency. In this project, you'll build a Python chatbot that interacts with users, answers their questions, and gathers information that you'll store in a cloud database.

8. Smart Traffic Management System that is cloud-based
Depending on how they move, this programme will reduce the amount of time that motor vehicles are stuck in traffic during peak hours. Effectiveness will increase with the addition of sensors and a wireless communication system. It also makes use of data extraction techniques to get information that you may utilize to make decisions.

9. Secure text transfer 
This is one of the most innovative concepts for an intermediate cloud project. In order to safeguard users' integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, the project aims to share textual data in a secure manner. Many banking applications use secure data exchange apps and services to transport information using particular routes. Data security and cloud computing are the project's primary areas. Encryption will be employed as a security technique to safeguard the information's properties. For encryption and decryption, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method is an excellent option. This makes it possible to use the private and public keys required for encryption and decryption. Two-way encryption will strengthen security in the project. Because a SQL database has built-in security features, it is recommended to store data there. Azure cloud servers can be used to activate the entire process.

10. E-learning 
E-learning has become a more popular educational method since the start of the Covid-19 epidemic. A cloud-based, always accessible e-learning platform is what this project aims to develop and implement. A simple Java-based cloud computing application that offers e-learning solutions could be made. Learning, sharing, and reuse will be the three key components of this software. The front end and app's offline and live sessions will be synchronized with the SQL database's learning resources. The application's functionality can be increased by integrating gamification with AI-based recommendation tools. You might, for instance, connect the app to databases and online libraries, then offer the students recommendations based on their browsing and academic background.

11. Project for Bug Tracking in Cloud Computing
Bug Tracker is easy to use and effective at finding and getting rid of a wide range of issues. These difficulties could be caused by grammatical, command, or communication mistakes. Consider an easier approach to recognizing these issues. By logging into the program using an authorized login and secure password, a person utilizing this tracker (who may be an administrator, a member of the staff, or a client) can determine the kind and origin of the bug. The individual can check the bug's specifications, such as when it was created, how long it existed in the system, and other details.

If a staff member is not affected directly or indirectly by the bug, the administrator may advise them of it, and vice versa. If the same (i.e., bug) is affecting them, the customers may also be given the bug's specifics. Customers will be able to communicate with the administrator directly for the necessary fixes if they are unable to find solutions to a problem. The time spent by customers examining the searches and labels in the Bug Tracker will be saved. The administrator's methods will enable a bug to be discovered and remedied more rapidly.

12. IoT remote monitoring and control
With the help of the Internet of Things, numerous devices can be connected to the Internet, and the data they collect is then kept in the cloud until it is time for analysis. You will use an Arduino and electric eyes (sensors) to gather data for this project, which you will then send to a Raspberry via a serial connection. The only database that can be used to access the collected data and store it on the cloud is MySQL, which is not included.

13. Detecting Data Leaks Using SQL
Data breaches have increased in frequency in the modern era, and the results can be dangerous for uninformed customers. They may occur in ways that are known or unknown since they take many different shapes. Several data breaches occur when someone steals your password when one of your pals properly remembers the keystrokes, or when ransomware seizes control of your computer and thoughts. In this project, a cloud computing system will be developed and encrypted using AESX.

Are you considering how this might help to mitigate SQL Injection and other existing security issues? The programme that detects data breaches will accurately do this by doing content inspection and contextual analysis. They will be used to group users based on their online communications or behavior, whether or not they are assaulters. Communications and users may be identified in the future if they mistakenly or actively cause security issues. Additionally, the software, which comes with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, will cleverly place limits on such individuals or take harsh action against them. This is done to prevent monetary or psychological losses. The main objective of this project is to protect the security and privacy of your personal information held on e-commerce websites that you might use regularly.
